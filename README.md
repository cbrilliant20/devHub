## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recY5PDzz1vhnlasl",
            "fields": {
                "category": "HTML",
                "description": "This is the MDN doc for HTML and there is a ton of good stuff to check out.\n",
                "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML",
                "title": "HTML: The Basics"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T04:05:33.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recmsfybuOJz6ZYUB",
            "fields": {
                "category": "CSS",
                "url": "https://www.w3schools.com/css/",
                "description": "This is the W3C tutorial for CSS and I learned so much by doing it. ",
                "title": "W3C CSS Tutorial"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T04:05:33.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recngvUktuFdNeIMO",
            "fields": {
                "category": "Javascipt",
                "url": "https://javascript.info/",
                "title": "Modern Javascript",
                "description": "How it's done now. From the basics to advanced topics with simple, but detailed explanations."
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-05-07T04:05:33.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recngvUktuFdNeIMO"
}
```

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Clear vision, app is solving a problem

### Weaknesses:

Categorizing the posts may be trickier then I think. Layout is a bit lopsided 

### Opportunities:

Can practice manipulating posts such as "post of the day" or adding user interaction with like counter buttons. Can practice css

### Threats:

May take more time than anticipated
